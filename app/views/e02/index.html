		<p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.timpaul.co.uk/posts/could-ai-convert-all-the-pdf-forms-on-gov-uk-into-web-forms/">Tims form-extractor-prototype</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LandRegistry/form-extractor-prototype">forked onto HMLR github</a>.  We've added a nunjuck function that outputs the form as nunjucks to copy and paste into a protoype - does the nunjcuks work?  What else do we want to do?</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">So this is a test of Ro's simple drawing of name and date of brith, and the nunjucks pasted here into 2 pages</p>

		<p>Note:
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>our extension makes the nunjucks for the input comonent and a continue button</li>
			<li>we make two blank gov pages - using the kit template function - called 1 and 2.html.  And copy/paste that nunjucks in.  It works!!!</li>
		</ul>
